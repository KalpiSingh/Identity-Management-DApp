This project can be used in universities and colleges to manage and securely store the identity credentials of students which can be helpful in many cases to verify the correct identity and catch the fraudulent ones.
Any student can be registered only ones with his blockchain (Metamask) account and no other student can be registered with same identity.
More logic can be added to the smart contract according to the college requirement to verify the student identity. (Eg. University Seat No. and other details can be included)
This code is deployed and tested on local Ganache environment.
Frontend uses HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap for styling.
It uses Web3.js library to interact with the smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and Metamask Interface for interacting and confirming transactions from frontend.
